# Daintree

Daintree is a fully functioning e-commerced storefront offering various products from clothing, homeware, toys, and electronics.

Users can use the search function to find desired products sold by Daintree. User's have the option to register to the website to track their previous orders and purchase a variety of products from the websites storefront. They can also go to create and view their own wishlists before comitting to a purchase within their cart. Users are also able to view, edit and delete from their own wishlists at any time with ease.

## User Experience (UX)

There is a clear navigation in the nav bar which directs you on where to view products to purchase or add to wishlists or cart. Then navbar also clearly directs you to the search function where you can search for individual users.

The website is designed to be simple and modern so that all users can find up to date and trending products they are seeking. For this reason, I kept the pages with contents of products central of the screen displaying 100 products per page. Products can be clicked on to view photos and descriptions of selected product. The product can then be added to the users wishlist or cart.


To make the user experience easy - I wanted the site to have:

* A simple and easy registration and sign up form
* A simple nav bar for children to get around the site easily.
* A simple UI. I wanted a minimal and clean design appearing on the screen to make it less cluttered offering categories with products Daintree sells to align with what products they are searching for


## User Stories
To determine which approach to take with site features I determined the goals of different users from first time through to frequent users.

### User

* First time User Goals
    * As a user, I want to understand the variety of products the website sells.
    * As a user, I want to understand how I can create an account or wishlist.
    * As a user, I want to understand how I can add a product to my cart in order to purchase a product from the website.
    * As a user, I want to understand how to easily navigate the site with simple and clear descriptions of what each page offers or entails.
    
* Returning User Goals
    * As a user, I want to get registered with an account and be able to sign in easily.
    * As a user, I want to be able to easily edit my wishlists or cart by being able to add or delete products to either.
    * As a user, I want to understand how to enquire about a product or order, and view when these enquiries have been resolved.

* Frequent User Goals
    * As a user, I want to be able to get started with my product searches quickly and with ease.
    * As a user, I want to see a simple, easy, and modern website with no added bloat since the last visit.

## Wire Frames

When designing this website, I intended to have a very minimal yet modern design that showed the websites main purpose.
I chose to keep the pages simple and clean.

## Design

### Colour

The colour scheme I wanted for the website kept the theme of simple, clean, and modern. I chose a natural feel and tone to link with the websites name, ‘Daintree’, using green and orange tones. For the background on the landing page, I chose an image of the Daintree rainforest with an individual exploring, to symbol users exploring the website.

For the background of other pages and the navbar I chose a green colour to match green tones from the landing page image and represent a rainforest.

* Main colours used on the website:
    * Text Colour: rgb(250, 83, 6) - This was chosen as a nice standout colour from the greens. I feel this stood out well against the green and kept a tropical rainforest theme.
    * Background colour: #002222 - This was to keep with the theme of a rainforest and match the tones in the landing page background image.

### Typography

* For the fonts I worked with the fonts on google fonts - These fonts are:
  * Pacifico
  * Helvetica

  
This covers a range of devices such as iOS, windows, android ETC.

I changed the font weight, to make it bolder and more readable. The result was a text that looked fitting for a website intending users to buy products. It makes it easy to read when looking for products.

### WireFrames

I created my wireframes using balsamiq wireframes. I found this simple and effective for assessing the sites appearance as it had a variety of ready available tools representing different parts of a website so I was able to design it how I envisioned it.

    ## Bugs

| Problem         | Action           | Status  |
| ------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------:| -----:|
| Users being taken to the super user page when marking their enquiry as resolved.| Intial "User" class was not allowing itself to be added to database or deleted in anyway. Created a new model table called Activeuser. This allowed forms to post and user details to be saved to the database/session| Fixed |
|  Issue with nav home button taking you back to register page when pressing home button.| Home button was connected to the landing page. I wanted it to redirect to this page when not signed in but the main page when signed in. Created an if statement that checked if the username was in session. If it was it takes you to the main page and if you are not signed in you get redirected to the landing page. I also applied this if statement to the brand logo.    |   Fixed |
| Relationship not correctly setup. | Issue with the relationships being setup incorrecly so that the db was requiring the user's ID to be filled in when submitting a form. Removed all databases from PSQL and then corrected the usermodels to reflect  the lists and folders in Activeuser model so set the relationship and tie the user to the lists.|    Fixed |
| Forms not posting to DB.| Route incorrectly setup. Checked if method -- post. From here I then created variables retrieving the form data. From here I applied them to a new instance under a new variable. I then commited that variable to the session and the form posted to the database.    |    Fixed |
Multiple users being displayed instead of just the user that created the list. .| Ran a check to see if user is in session. If they are, I created a variable that checks the session. This then checks if the owner ID of the form mathces the user ID that's in session. If it does the site will display the users username on the list instead of a loop running every username|    Fixed |

## Deployment and local Development.

### Relational Database Management System

This project uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) for the relationable database management system.

* To obtain your database you have to use Code Institute's database creator [PostgreSQL](https://dbs.ci.net) or use heroku's paid services for a database.
* If using the Code Institute creator. Enter your email address and hit submit. From here your database will be created and emailed to you.

### Heroku

This project uses Heroku to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

To achieve this you have to:

* Generate the requirements.txt file with the following command in the terminal. After you run this command a new file called requirements.txt should appear in your root directory.
![how to get requirements.txt .](santashelpers/static/images/requirements.png "Requirements")

* Heroku requires a Procfile containing a command to run your program. Inside the root directory of your project create the new file. It must be called Procfile with a capital P, otherwise Heroku won’t recognise it. Inside the file, add the following command

![Procfile command.](santashelpers/static/images/procfile-image.png "Procfile")

* To ensure that SQLAlchemy can also read the external database, its URL needs to start with “postgresql://”, but You can not change this in the environment variable. Instead, make an addition to the else statement to adjust the DATABASE_URL in case it starts with postgres://:

![An image showing the repository page with settings highlighted.](/santashelpers/static/images/db-for-loop.png "Settings")

*  ### Heroku Deployment

I used heroku to deploy the live site database. To do this you have to:

* Log into Heroku.com and click “New” and then “Create a new app”
* Choose a unique name for the app, select the region closest to you and click “Create app”
* Go to the Settings tab of your new app and click reveal config vars.
* Add each of your other environment variables except DEVELOPMENT and DB_URL from the env.py file as a Config Var. The result should look something like this:

![An image showing the repository page with settings highlighted.](santashelpers/static/images/config%20vars.png "Settings")
* Login to github, search for your repository and click Connect.
* Now, your project is in place, It's time to take place adding tables to the database. Hit more then run console.

![An image showing the repository page with settings highlighted.](santashelpers/static/images/run-console.png "Settings")
* Type python3 into the console and click Run
* Once loaded type:  from santashelpers import db to import our database. 
Once this loads type: - db.create_all().
