# Daintree

Daintree is a fully functioning e-commerced storefront offering various products from clothing, homeware, toys, and electronics.

Users can use the search function to find desired products sold by Daintree. User's have the option to register to the website to track their previous orders and purchase a variety of products from the websites storefront. They can also go to create and view their own wishlists before comitting to a purchase within their cart. Users are also able to view, edit and delete from their own wishlists at any time with ease.

## User Experience (UX)

There is a clear navigation in the nav bar which directs you on where to view products to purchase or add to wishlists or cart. Then navbar also clearly directs you to the search function where you can search for individual users.

The website is designed to be simple and modern so that all users can find up to date and trending products they are seeking. For this reason, I kept the pages with contents of products central of the screen displaying 100 products per page. Products can be clicked on to view photos and descriptions of selected product. The product can then be added to the users wishlist or cart.


To make the user experience easy - I wanted the site to have:

* A simple and easy registration and sign up form
* A simple nav bar for children to get around the site easily.
* A simple UI. I wanted a minimal and clean design appearing on the screen to make it less cluttered offering categories with products Daintree sells to align with what products they are searching for


## User Stories
To determine which approach to take with site features I determined the goals of different users from first time through to frequent users.

### User

* First time User Goals
    * As a user, I want to understand the variety of products the website sells.
    * As a user, I want to understand how I can create an account or wishlist.
    * As a user, I want to understand how I can add a product to my cart in order to purchase a product from the website.
    * As a user, I want to understand how to easily navigate the site with simple and clear descriptions of what each page offers or entails.
    
* Returning User Goals
    * As a user, I want to get registered with an account and be able to sign in easily.
    * As a user, I want to be able to easily edit my wishlists or cart by being able to add or delete products to either.
    * As a user, I want to understand how to enquire about a product or order, and view when these enquiries have been resolved.

* Frequent User Goals
    * As a user, I want to be able to get started with my product searches quickly and with ease.
    * As a user, I want to see a simple, easy, and modern website with no added bloat since the last visit.

## Wire Frames

When designing this website, I intended to have a very minimal yet modern design that showed the websites main purpose.
I chose to keep the pages simple and clean. 


### Wireframe for Desktop, Tablet and Mobile.

## Design

### Colour

The colour scheme I wanted for the website kept the theme of simple, clean, and modern. I chose a natural feel and tone to link with the websites name, ‘Daintree’, using green and orange tones. For the background on the landing page, I chose an image of the Daintree rainforest with an individual exploring, to symbol users exploring the website.

For the background of other pages and the navbar I chose a green colour to match green tones from the landing page image and represent a rainforest.

* Main colours used on the website:
    * Text Colour: rgb(250, 83, 6) - This was chosen as a nice standout colour from the greens. I feel this stood out well against the green and kept a tropical rainforest theme.
    * Background colour: #002222 - This was to keep with the theme of a rainforest and match the tones in the landing page background image.

### Typography

* For the fonts I worked with the fonts on google fonts - These fonts are:
  * Pacifico
  * Helvetica

  
This covers a range of devices such as iOS, windows, android ETC.

I changed the font weight, to make it bolder and more readable. The result was a text that looked fitting for a website intending users to buy products. It makes it easy to read when looking for products.

### WireFrames

I created my wireframes using balsamiq wireframes. I found this simple and effective for assessing the sites appearance as it had a variety of ready available tools representing different parts of a website so I was able to design it how I envisioned it.

    ## Bugs

| Problem         | Action           | Status  |
| ------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------:| -----:|
| Users being taken to the super user page when marking their enquiry as resolved.| I updated the enquiry detail view to handle the users and superuser actions different based on authentication. Users are redirected back to their enquiries page however super users remain on the superuser enquiries page.| Fixed |
|  Issue with products in wishlist not being removed when clicking the button.| The remove_from_wishlist view needed updating to correctly remove items and store the removed product in the session. As a result users can add or remove products at any time. They can even add products they had previously added before if they want to.   |   Fixed |
| Payment not succeeding | Issue with the link to the stripe secret key. I was setting stripe secret keys in a .env. I linked this in the settings page but it would still not pick that up in the webhook. I then updated the webhook to take the secret keys direct from the .env instead of the settings. Once this was done payments were processing as expected. |    Fixed |

## Deployment and local Development.

### Relational Database Management System

This project uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) for the relationable database management system.

* To obtain your database you have to use Code Institute's database creator [PostgreSQL](https://dbs.ci.net) or use heroku's paid services for a database.
* If using the Code Institute creator. Enter your email address and hit submit. From here your database will be created and emailed to you.

### Heroku

This project uses Heroku to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

To achieve this you have to:

* Generate the requirements.txt file with the following command in the terminal. After you run this command a new file called requirements.txt should appear in your root directory.

* Heroku requires a Procfile containing a command to run your program. Inside the root directory of your project create the new file. It must be called Procfile with a capital P, otherwise Heroku won’t recognise it.

Inside the file, type: echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile
replace app_name with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located

*  ### Heroku Deployment

I used heroku to deploy the live site database. To do this you have to:

* Log into Heroku.com and click “New” and then “Create a new app”
* Choose a unique name for the app, select the region closest to you and click “Create app”
* Go to the Settings tab of your new app and click reveal config vars.
* Add each of your other environment variables except DEVELOPMENT and DB_URL from the env.py file as a Config Var. The result should look something like this:
* Login to github, search for your repository and click Connect.

## Amazon AWS

This project uses [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to store media and static files online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

Once you've created an AWS account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected. Make sure you're on the AWS Management Console page.

### S3

* Search for S3

* Create a new bucket, give it a name (matching your Heroku app name), and choose the region closest to you.

* Uncheck Block all public access, and acknowledge that the bucket will be public (required for it to work on Heroku).

* From Object Ownership, make sure to have ACLs enabled, and Bucket owner preferred selected

* From the Properties tab, turn on static website hosting, and type index.html and error.html in their respective fields, then click Save.

* From the Permissions tab, paste in the following CORS configuration:

<pre>
    <code>
 [
 	{
 		"AllowedHeaders": [
 			"Authorization"
 		],
 		"AllowedMethods": [
 			"GET"
 		],
 		"AllowedOrigins": [
 			"*"
 		],
 		"ExposeHeaders": []
 	}
 ]
    </code>
</pre>

* For the Access control list (ACL) section, click edit and enable List for Everyone (public access) and accept the warning box

* Select your bucket and copy the ARN for the time being - Next is IAM.

### IAM

* Search for ‘iam’ in the search bar at the top
![IAM](/deployment/search_iam.png "IAM")

* Click ‘User Groups’ on the left

![User Groups](/deployment/user_groups.png "IAM")

* Click ‘Create Group’ - Enter a group name. For consisitency, use the same one as your Heroku app. Then scroll to the bottom and click ‘Create user group.

* Click ‘Policies’ in the menu to the left:

![Policies](/deployment/policies.png "IAM")

* Click Create policy, then select the JSON tab. 

* Click the actions tab and select import policy.

* From here search for S3 and select ‘AmazonS3FullAccess’ then select 'Import policy'.

* Add your bucket ARN that you copied earlier in quotes to the ‘Resource’ list twice, for the second one add /* after the ARN. It should look like this.

<pre>
    <code>
"arn:aws:s3:::test-bucket-2024",
"arn:aws:s3:::test-bucket-2024/*"
    </code>
</pre>


* Search for the policy you've just created and select it, then Attach Policy. 

* The policy should look like the below:

<pre>
    <code>
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "Statement1",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": [
				"s3:*"
			],
			"Resource": [
				"YOUR_ARN",
				"YOUR_ARN/*"
			]
		}
	]
}
    </code>
</pre>

* Scroll down to the bottom and click next - Enter a policy name and description then scroll down and select 'Create Policy'

* From User Groups, click Add User and add (user + the project name)

* For "Select AWS Access Type", select Programmatic Access.

* Select the group to add your new user to

* Tags are optional, but you must click it to get to the review user page. Click Create User once done.

* You should see a button to Download .csv, so click it to save a copy on your system.
IMPORTANT: once you pass this page, you cannot come back to download it again, so do it immediately!

* This contains the user's Access key ID and Secret access key.
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = Access key ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = Secret access key

* In Heroku Config Vars remove DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC still, so that AWS will handle the static files.

* Add the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY to your heroku config vars. Also add USE_AWS and set it to true.

* Back within S3, create a new folder called: media

* Select any existing media images for your project to prepare them for being uploaded into the new folder.

* Under Manage Public Permissions, select Grant public read access to this object(s). - No further settings are required, so click Upload.

### Stripe

* From your Stripe dashboard, click to expand the "Get your test API keys".

* Add the STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY & STRIPE_SECRET_KEY to your heroku config vars.

* Select webhooks and click add endpoint. Post your deploted heroku website link and add /checkout/wh/ to the end of that.

* Retrieve all events then add the endpoint to complete the process.

* Take your signing secret hook and and to heroku config vars as STRIPE_WH_SECRET.

 
### Github
